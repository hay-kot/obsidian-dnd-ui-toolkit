# Obsidian DnD UI Toolkit

This plugin provides modern UI elements for playing Dungeons and Dragons that provide building blocks for you to build
a beautiful markdown driven character sheet.

I built this plugin because I was tired of working with PDFs and online tools to manage my characters. I wanted to keep my notes, spells, and character state (Spell Slots, HP, etc..) all in my notebook. I'm building this plugin to make that process easier.
