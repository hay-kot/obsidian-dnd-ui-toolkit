## What You Get

This basic setup gives you:

- **Ability Scores**: Interactive ability score display with saving throws
- **Skills**: Automatically calculated skill modifiers
- **Health Tracking**: Persistent HP tracking with hit dice
- **Resource Management**: Spell slots and abilities that reset with rests
- **Rest System**: Buttons to trigger rest events

## Important Concepts

### State Keys

Every component that tracks data needs a unique `state_key` across your vault. A good rule of
thumb is to prefix whatever keys you have with your character's name

- ❌ `level_1_spells`
- ✅ `din_level_1_spells`

### File Scope

Events (like rest buttons) only affect components in the same file. This means each character sheet can have its own rest system without interfering with others.
